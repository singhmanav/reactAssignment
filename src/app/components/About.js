Our Guidance
</h3>
<p>
Xebia Group companies operate on three distinct principles: Authority, Focus and Values. These principles guide every decision made by both management and staff. Authority means becoming the best in our field, individually and as a company. Itâ€™s an audacious goal that keeps us striving and fighting. We only hire people who have achieved authority, not for growth, open positions, size or value.
</p>
<h3>
People First
</h3>
<p>
People First
You grow. We grow. Xebia puts People First, always. With a thrust on personal development Xebia provides a mutual atmosphere of respect, trust, responsibility and accountability that helps foster great ideas and innovation.
</p>
<h3>
Sharing Knowledge
</h3>
<p>
Xebia believes in Sharing Knowledge. The more you share it, the more it grows. With mandatory bi-weekly sessions of Xebia Knowledge Exchange, Xebia ensures a flow of knowledge from country to country, unit to unit and employee to employee.
</p>
<h3>
Customer Intimacy
</h3>
<p>
We don't just create customers, we create relationships through Customer Intimacy. We work on common goals and trust, by being truly interested in the person and adding value pro-actively and consistently.
</p>
<h3>
Quality without Compromise
</h3>
<p>
At Xebia Quality Without Compromise is the Mantra. Be it work, be it personal interactions, be it the surroundings or be it the self, at Xebia 100% is the norm. Because enough is just not enough.
